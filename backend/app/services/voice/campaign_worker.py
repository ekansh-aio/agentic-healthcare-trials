"""
Bulk outbound call campaign worker.

Runs as asyncio background tasks — no Celery/Redis required.
All state lives in the DB: on container restart, lifespan calls
resume_running_campaigns() to re-spawn workers for any campaigns
still in "running" status.

Concurrency model
-----------------
- asyncio.Semaphore(concurrency) caps simultaneous in-flight dials.
- min_gap = 60 / per_minute paces dial-start rate.
- _dial() is fire-and-forget — the main loop does NOT await it.

Completion model
----------------
- Worker exits once no more "pending" records remain, marks campaign "done".
- voice_webhook.py calls mark_record_outcome() as ElevenLabs posts outcomes.
- run_stale_sweeper() (started in main.py) resets records stuck in
  dialing/in_progress for >15 min to "no_answer".
